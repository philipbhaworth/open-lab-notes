# About Me

![Avatar](assets/images/avatar-5.jpg){ align=right width="200" }

I wasn't always the "tech person." In fact, I came to it a little late — but once I found my nerdy obsession, I never looked back. What started as pure frustration (my Mac was no longer supported and I refused to just replace it) turned into a deep curiosity about Linux… which eventually turned into a career in systems administration.

My path to tech wasn't linear — I spent years in customer service, solving problems, managing projects, and working with people from all kinds of backgrounds. Looking back, those experiences were just as important. They taught me how to communicate clearly, build trust, be creative in my problem solving, and create documentation that actually helps someone.

Today, I work in research computing — building infrastructure, supporting storage and HPC systems, and automating the boring stuff so people can focus on real work. When I'm not at work, I'm in the homelab, learning something new (or breaking something) and taking notes like my life depends on it (because honestly, sometimes it does).

## This site is where I share:

- The lessons I learn in real time
- The guides and references I wish I had earlier in my journey  
- My lab notes, experiments, and thought process — especially the messy parts

I surround myself with people who are smarter than me, stay curious, and never stop learning — and I hope anyone who visits this space feels encouraged to do the same.
