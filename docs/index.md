# Welcome to Open Lab Notes

This space is a mix of technical documentation, lab notes, and real-world experiments—all pulled from my work in research computing and my never-ending homelab projects.

I created it because I learn best when I write things down and share them. It’s not a polished knowledge base. It’s a living collection of things I’ve tried, broken, fixed, and learned—from Linux internals and automation frameworks to distributed storage and productivity tooling.

## 🔧 What You’ll Find Here

**[Documentation](documentation/)** – Step-by-step guides and reference materials based on real systems and actual problems ( a collection of notes I wish I had in the beginning) .

  - **Infrastructure** – Notes and walkthroughs on storage (Ceph, ZFS), HPC environments, virtualization, and networking.

  - **Automation** – Hands-on examples using tools like Ansible, Puppet, and containers/orchestration.

  - **Systems** – Linux administration, shell tools, scripting tips, and the random things that make servers actually work.

**[Lab Notes](notes/)** – Unfiltered posts capturing experiments, failures, and discoveries as they happen. Less blog, more “working notebook.”
